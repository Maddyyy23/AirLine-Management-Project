# AirLine Management System using Java and MySQL

Airline Management System is the administration of airports and airlines. It includes the activities of setting the strategy of airports to gather and provide information on airline commercial and operational priorities.It covers a broad overview of the airline management. It is also studied as a branch of study that teaches management of airport and airlines. This provides a broad overview of the airline industry and creates awareness of the underlying marketing, financial, operational, and other factors influencing airline management.

 **Problem Definition**

This project on AirLine Management System is the automation of registration process of airline system. The system is able to provide much information like passenger’s details, flight details and the booking details. The system allows us to add records when a passenger reserves a ticket. It also allows to delete and update the records based on passenger’s requirements. For data storage and retrieval we use the MySQL database. It enables us to add any number of records in our database from the frontend which is Java core. Any changes made in the frontend will be reflected at the backend.

**Need** 

Electronically handling of flight’s record to enhance the accuracy, flexibility, reliability and to remove the human’s error. An airline provides air transport services for passengers, generally with a recognize operating. To provide accurate information about the addition, deletion and modified record. To provide, efficient, accurate, reliable, fast, and robust structure that can handle any number of records. The global airline industry continues to grow rapidly, but consistent and robust profitability is elusive. Measured by revenue, the industry has doubled over the past decade, from US$369 billion in 2004 to a projected $746 billion in 2014, according to the International Air Transport Association(IATA).Much of that growth has been driven by low-cost carriers(LCCs), which now control some 25 percent of the worldwide market and which have been expanding rapidly in emerging markets; growth also came from continued gains by carriers in developed markets, the IATA reported. Yet profit margins are still low, less than 3 percent overall. In the commercial aviation sector, just about every group in the aviation industry chain—airports, airplane manufacturers, jet engine makers, travel agents, and service companies, to name a few—turns a profit. It is seemingly ironic that the airline companies that actually move passengers from one place to another, the most crucial link in the chain, struggle to make a profit.
A few factors that directs us to develop a new system are given below -:
1)Faster System 
2)Accuracy
3)Reliability
4)Informative
5)Reservations and cancellations from any where to any place

## Implementations

**Backend Implementation**

**MYSQL**

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).  A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups. 

**Frontend Implementation**

**Java Core**

Core Java is the part of Java programming language that is used for creating or developing a general-purpose application. It uses only one tier architecture that is why it is called as ‘stand alone’ application.Core java programming covers the swings, socket, awt, thread concept, collection object and classess.

**Swings**

Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC) – an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs. 
Swing provides a look and feel that emulates the look and feel of several platforms, and also supports a pluggable look and feel that allows applications to have a look and feel unrelated to the underlying platform. It has more powerful and flexible components than AWT. In addition to familiar components such as buttons, check boxes and labels, Swing provides several advanced components such as tabbed panel, scroll panes, trees, tables, and lists.
